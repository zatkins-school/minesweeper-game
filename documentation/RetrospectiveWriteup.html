			<h1>Retrospective Write Up</h1>

			This is the retrospective write up for Bits Please Project 2 - Minesweeper 2.0. The Minesweeper project was originally
			created by Ian Farris, Thor Lyche, Robert Nickel, Tony Nguyen and Emilia Paz. The Bits Please team, consisting of Zachary Atkins,
			Gage Phillips, Jacob Marshall, and Thomas Gartman altered that project to create minesweeper 2.0. This document exists to meet
			requirements for EECS 448.
