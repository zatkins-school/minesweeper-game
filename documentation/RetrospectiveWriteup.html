			<h1>Retrospective Write Up</h1>

			This is the retrospective write up for Bits Please Project 2 - Minesweeper 2.0. The Minesweeper project was originally
			created by Ian Farris, Thor Lyche, Robert Nickel, Tony Nguyen and Emilia Paz. The Bits Please team, consisting of Zachary Atkins,
			Gage Phillips, Jacob Marshall, and Thomas Gartman altered that project to create minesweeper 2.0. This document exists to meet
			requirements for EECS 448.

			<h2>Challenges Faced by the Team</h2>
				<div style = "margin-left: 40px">
					<p>This section lists a few challenges we faced as a team and how we overcame those challenges.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lack of Javascript/Web Development Knowledge: Even with the previous experience of EECS 368 and Zachary's web development internship, Javascript proved to be a major challenge to the team. We struggled to turn our Javascript
						into actions on the HTMl page. All this took was time with the language and a lot of tutorial watching to solve!</li>
						<li>Unexpected Feature Implementations: One of the major hurdles to implementing the required changes to the code ended up being how the project 1 team, Tritens, chose to implement minesweeper. Besides some minor bugs, like a
						Type error whenever the screen was clicked, all of our struggle with inheriting the code ended up as struggles to understand why problems were solved in certain ways. A great example is the graphical elements like the numbers.
						The other team decided to implement the numbers as vertex by vertex DOM drawings instead of displaying images in Javascript. It took some time before we truly understood that information.</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Features Cut from Demo</h2>
				<div style="margin-left: 40px">
					<p>This section focuses on features we wish we could implement but simply ran out of time to achieve. A description of all features is included.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Screen Spinning: We tried to sneak in a last minute addition into intense mode - namely that the grid would have a 5% chance of spinning whenever a space was revealed, on top of all of the other things that occur.
						We got the grid to spin around 360 degree and continue playing, but the limited time remaining prevented us from figuring out a stable way to combine the screen spinning CSS with the screen shaking CSS. At the end, we decided
					  this feature was not worth possibly breaking the game so close to demo.</li>
					</ul>
